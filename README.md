# liri-node-app

#Features
1. "spotify-this-song" "song name" - this allows a user to type in this command and search through the spotify API for information and a preview link for the song

2. "movie-this" "movie name" - this pulls information from the OMBD API and displays it to the user

3. "concert-this" "artist name" - this searches through the bands in town API and displays all upcoming events and their locations to the user

3. "do-what-it-says" - a test function that reads from random.txt and follows the command given to it

#Purpose
    The purpose of developing this was to create a CLI node application that simply searched through several different API databases.
